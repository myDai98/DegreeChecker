The instructions about how to use the website is on the HELP menu, here we just introduce how to use parser.py to automatically generate json data file for courses taken by Smith College Student.

(All steps in Chrome, OS)

Dependency: 
Python 3, BeautifulSoup Library 

1. Go to BannerWeb and open your online transcript.
(BannerWeb -- Student -- Student Record Memu -- Unofficial Transcript
-- All Levels, Official Web -- Submit)

2. Save the webpage in htm form 
(Right Click -- Save As -- Format:Web Page, Complete)

3. Then run the parser.py in Python3
Move the htm file to the same directory, and change python code’s file name to your file name. Then in the same directory there will be a data file named “courseList.json”.

4. Open the website, then enter your degree information and click submit

5. Then click “choose file” and submit the “courseList.json” file

6. Down and your can play with it. 


## New Technique

We use regular expression and BeautifulSoup to implement the parser, which is new for this class. 

## Solved Logical Error
1. The Wrong Movement of Course Node
Sometimes moving the node may move the course into wrong set. We reset the information about canvas boundary and solve thi issue.

## Unsolved Logical Error
1. Shared Course between Majors
The program cannot count the cross-registered courses twice in both majors/minors. We did not solve this issue because it will cause
another problem of counting the total credits. It has a conflict so we decided to keep it.
